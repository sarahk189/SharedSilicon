# Project: Shared Silicon (ASP.NET Core Web Application & Web API)
The Shared Silicon project combines a graphical ASP.NET Core web application and a secure ASP.NET Core Web API. The web application follows a detailed design template and requires various pages with user authentication, responsive design, and dynamic functionality—such as course management and account features—depending on the achievement level. The Web API provides endpoints for newsletter subscriptions, course retrieval, and contact inquiries, with advanced security measures (API key and AccessToken) implemented at the High Pass level. 
This project demonstrates proficiency in ASP.NET Core, modern web development practices, and secure API design.
